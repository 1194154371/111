## Introduction
### This project is based on a webpage developed by CS50 IDE/MySQL/Google Map. The main function is to set up hot spots, locate hot crowds, and manage different target crowds. Among them, the population is divided into three categories, administrators, health officials (managers of hotspots), and ordinary users.

## Hot spot
###

### In the hotspot area function, we can set the name of the hotspot area, the introduction of the hotspot name, and set a health official to manage this area.The administrator can click to circle an area on the map.
## Sign in management
### With the sign-in function, the user can fill in the address on the webpage to sign-in or click to allow the webpage to read the user's ip address and location information.
